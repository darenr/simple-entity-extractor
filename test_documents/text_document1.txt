Today the photography collection numbers more than 17,000 objects, and is the largest collection
  at the museum. Its strengths include outstanding examples of work by West Coast modernist masters
  such as Ansel Adams, Edward Weston and their counterparts on the East Coast, most notably Alfred
  Stieglitz and Charles Sheeler. A small but important group of European modernist works by Hans
  Bellmer, Claude Cahun, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Man Ray, among others, represents another highlight
  of this period. The collection also demonstrates a deep commitment to the work of major 20th-
  and 21st-century figures, including Robert Adams, Diane Arbus, Lewis Baltz, Rineke Dijkstra,
  William Eggleston and Larry Sultan.
